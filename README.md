# Final-Project

R Markdown

This Markdown Report is an extensive professional portfolio for me to pull from
when applying for jobs and creating targeted resumes. I have been wanting to put
this together for awhile as I am starting to apply for real jobs next year, so
this assignment was perfect for compiling these things into an organized doc. 

I included at the beginning what looks like typical resume entries, but with 
more detail and bullet points to pick and choose from when building a targeted
resume.

I also included a portfolio of the details of specific projects that I have 
worked on, including some example deliverables.
